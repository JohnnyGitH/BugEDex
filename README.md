# Bugedex

![Animal Crossing Title image](src/assets/images/bugReadmeimage.jpg)

## About

Once you start up the application you will find yourself at http://localhost:4200/bugs.

There will be a list of bugs from Animal Crossing, so cute. However my bugEdex is a little broken, so it only shows bugs that are around All Day.

When you select a bug, you will be redirected to http://localhost:4200/bug?name={{selected bug name}} and the information for that bug will be presented.

Back on the main bugs page, you can also click a checkmark to indicate if you have caught the bug or not. When checking out the details of any of the bugs, your caught status will also appear with a checkbox.

Requested Work:
- Create methods in service so state isn't exposed directly to the component
- check if filter in Bug service does what i think it does
- Update logger
- Fix tests broken by these changes

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
